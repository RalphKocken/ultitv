ULTI.TV is the Ultimate Frisbee Entertainment TV Network. Its mission is to showcase the sport of Ultimate Frisbee ü•è to people all around the world in an equitable, fair and diverse way. ULTI.TV produces free to watch LIVE Games on their YouTube and short documentaries about culture in the sport. 

We are a group of freelancers all around the world with a couple of part time people in Europe, UK and Australia. Most of us played the sport ourselves and are really passionate about it. 

Ultimate Frisbee is a team sport which is played in three divisions, Men, Women‚Äôs and Mixed Gender. The mixed gender part makes it unique, as it is the largest mixed gender played team sport in the world. See a video here made by us.  

We make constant efforts in making the sport more entertaining to watch. This is partly bettering the production but also with more storytelling about the players. One of our products is called Commentary Source and it‚Äôs a tool for players and coaches to fill in their information about themselves and their team.

Commentary Source is then used by commentators ‚Äî the people telling the story live during the game ‚Äî to see the information while the game is on. It‚Äôs also a tool to keep and see game statistics.


## Reason for the project
We want to take the project to the next level with young pioneering students. We want to get a new perspective on what we have built. But also, a lot of what we do is voluntary work, 99% of the players play as amateurs, there‚Äôs no big sponsors yet so we‚Äôre also pioneering. So this means we have little budgets to work with, most of the time there‚Äôs no budget.

But we manage to livestream more than 30 events a year and produce hundreds of videos for our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/ultidottv). We have been doing this for 13 years and we‚Äôre not slowing down. 

## The assignment
The app that the commentary team use to see all the information they need for the game, is currently written in Aurelia. This was a reasonably good framework in it's day but as now fallen out of support and no longer receives updates. As a result we'd love to get it rebuilt. We also haven't had any external input into the development of the project and new design ideas are long overdue. 

We'd like to see the front end of the application be rebuilt in a technology of your choice (we have a slight preference towards [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (because it's amazing)).
