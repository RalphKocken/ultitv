ULTI.TV is the Ultimate Frisbee Entertainment TV Network. Its mission is to showcase the sport of Ultimate Frisbee ü•è to people all around the world in an equitable, fair and diverse way. ULTI.TV produces free to watch LIVE Games on their YouTube and short documentaries about culture in the sport. 

We are a group of freelancers all around the world with a couple of part time people in Europe, UK and Australia. Most of us played the sport ourselves and are really passionate about it. 

Ultimate Frisbee is a team sport which is played in three divisions, Men, Women‚Äôs and Mixed Gender. The mixed gender part makes it unique, as it is the largest mixed gender played team sport in the world. See a video here made by us.  

We make constant efforts in making the sport more entertaining to watch. This is partly bettering the production but also with more storytelling about the players. One of our products is called Commentary Source and it‚Äôs a tool for players and coaches to fill in their information about themselves and their team.
